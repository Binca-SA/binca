                        <br></br>
                        <p className='font-size-m'> In April 2023 I received a proposal to collaborate with the agency Mediterrània Creativa for a commission that the town council of Altea (a coastal town in the province of Alicante) had given them.</p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        <p className='font-size-m'>We had to redesign the website of Navarro Ramón (1903-1989), a famous local painter. The aim was to get to know the artist better through a website so that people could immerse themselves in his pictorial world. This website should also inform about the commemorative events, exhibitions and activities that take place around Spain about the artist. </p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        <p className='font-size-m'>I thought it was a very interesting project as I studied Fine Arts in Altea so it seemed like a good way to contribute to the culture of the town. </p>
                    
                    </div>

                    <div className="cont-subtitles">
                        <h3 className="subtitles-work margin-top-sm">The problems</h3>
                        <br></br>
                        <p className='font-size-m'><b>After a detailed evaluation of the website and taking into account the feedback received from the city council, I took the opportunity to <strong className='hightlight-yellow'>offer some constructive observations aimed at improving the digital representation of the artist and encouraging greater interaction and engagement with the audience:</strong> </b></p>
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        <ul>
                            <li> The current design of the website presents a rather basic and linear structure, similar to a word document, which can result in an uninspiring user experience. This approach does not seem to adequately capture and reflect the essence and creativity of the artist, which is crucial to generate an emotional connection with visitors.</li>
                            <br></br>
                            <li>Lack of interactive elements, such as a multimedia gallery, dynamic sections, etc., significantly limits the user experience.</li>
                            <br></br>
                            <li>Lack of sections highlighting works, exhibitions and awards</li>
                            <br></br>
                            <li>Too much text taking up entire pages with minuscule font size and lack of artist's works. </li>
                            <br></br>
                            <li>Lack of a biography page</li>
                            <br></br>
                            <li>Since most users access the website through a qr code that is in an exhibition in Altea, the website is not prepared for optimal viewing on mobile phones, this is an essential point for a user not to close the page and browse freely.</li>
                        </ul>
